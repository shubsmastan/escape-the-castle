# Escape the Castle

A simple text RPG adventure game. You are trapped in a castle dungeon alone with no hope for survival. Can you escape?

## Description

I first created this text RPG using Python on an OOP course for teachers. As I started to learn web design, I decided to upgrade the project to a web game. The code is quite inefficient and messy as it was made in my early programming days, but it was a big achievement and very educational.

## How to play

To play the game, type any of the valid actions in any case.
